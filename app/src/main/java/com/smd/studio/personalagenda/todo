You should add a button to the ActionBar that when pressed will bring up a DialogFragment and show your next available 30 minute time slot.
So basically a way to find out when you're available for a quick meeting.

    • Availability checker must find an open slot at the next 30 minute increment from the current time.
    If current time is 5:33 then the soonest available slot you should find is 6:00

    • Only events with an availability of Busy should be considered as time slots that you aren't available for

    • Allow for user to choose between 30 minutes or 1 hour time slot for availability check.
    So instead of finding an open 30 minute window you would be finding an open 1 hour window where there are no other events.
